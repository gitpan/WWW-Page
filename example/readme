Example of how to use WWW::Page module for creating XSLT-based web-site.

This example is a demonstration of how to create a blog with tagging, search and month-calendar.

Enroll your http://localhost/ (or whatever) and ensure the following:

1. document root is beeing pointed to example/www;
2. allow .htaccess for example/www;
3. point script aliases to example/cgi;
4. create database 'blog' and update its credentials at example/cgi/Import/Datasource.pm.

Database scheme is in example/data/scheme.sql, sample data are in example/data/example-data.sql.

Use http://localhost/ to view the web-site, and http://localhost/adm/ to add or edit messages.

Future versions of WWW::Page will have more detailed description.

Please write to the author any your thoughts.
